# PyBer_Analysis
Analyzing all ridesharing data from January to May 2019 from PyBer
## Analysis Overview
- The purpose of this analysis is to analyze different fare statistics per City Type and fare per city type for a four-month 
period of 2019 (1/1 to 4/28).

## Challenge Results
- 
- 
- From the Data Frame and the Multi line graph, we can see that Rural drivers bring in the least revenue for total fares, but they have the most expensive fare per ride and driver. This is the exact inverse for Urban drivers, as they bring in the most revenue, but have the cheapest average fare per ride and driver.

##Summary
- Mr. Vanderbilt, I recommend that we spread some of the Urban Drivers out to the Suburban and Rural city Areas. Mostly drivers that would either be driving from a rural/suburban city to get to an urban city so that they could get mor opportunities for rides. I believe a split of 100 drivers from Urban to Suburban and 675 drivers from Urban to Rural Areas. I believe this would work because it would make it cheaper for rural areas to afford our service and bring in more revenue this way. It would also increase revenue for Urban drivers because the price will increase per driver and ride, but the urban citizens are more likely to afford this and pay for it. The suburban driver increase should decrease the average ride and driver fare a little but should increase revenue because of more availability of drivers. Please consider this at the next board meeting.
